In order to test our [agent playing Minecraft]({{site.url}}/projects/drqn-minecraft) on a Tic-Tac-Toe environment, I removed the game part from the [DeepQ-Learning TicTacToe project]({{site.url}}/projects/deepqlearning-tictactoe) to make it an independant project. As we were using OpenAI Gym with [gym-minecraft](https://github.com/tambetm/gym-minecraft), I made an OpenAI Gym like ennvironment. 

This new project is now used in our [DeepQ-Learning TicTacToe project]({{site.url}}/projects/deepqlearning-tictactoe).

You can find this project [here](https://github.com/ClementRomac/gym-tictactoe) and use it if you want to apply Reinforcement Learning to Tic-Tac-Toe easily.
