## About Me

Hi, I am Clément Romac. I am Research Scientist at Hugging Face and a thrid-year PhD student jointly supervised by Pierre-Yves Oudeyer ([FLOWERS team, Inria Bordeaux](https://flowers.inria.fr/)) and Thomas Wolf (Hugging Face) studying how curiosity-driven RL can help grounding Large Language Models. 

Previously, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Weenove](https://www.weenove.fr/) and as a Research Engineer in the FLOWERS team working on Automatic Curriculum Learning for Deep RL and Automated scientific discovery in complex systems (e.g. self-organizing). 
I am also co-animating the [Machine Learning Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/Bordeaux-Machine-Learning-Meetup/) of Bordeaux. 


## Research Interests
My research focuses on Reinforcement Learning (RL) and how it can shape artificial agents' knowledge. I notably study how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be grounded through online interactions with an environment using RL. I am interested in open-ended learning setups and my reseach often involves methods such as curiosity-driven RL or Automatic Curriculum Learning.
