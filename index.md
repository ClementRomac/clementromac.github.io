## About Me

Hi, I’m Clément Romac. After graduating in Computer Science engineering from Ingesup with a Data Science specialisation, while part time working on Automated Machine Learning in a startup called [Weenove](https://www.weenove.fr/), I obtained a MSc. in theoretical Computer Science at the University of Bordeaux (France). Shortly after, I joined the [FLOWERS team at Inria Bordeaux](https://flowers.inria.fr/) as a Research Engineer working on Automatic Curriculum Learning for Deep RL and Automated scientific discovery in complex systems (e.g. self-organizing). 

I'm now a Research Scientist at Hugging Face and second year PhD student jointly supervised by Pierre-Yves Oudeyer (FLOWERS, Inria) and Thomas Wolf (Hugging Face) studying how autonomous Deep RL agents can leverage Large Language Models. I am aslo co-animating the [Machine Learning Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/Bordeaux-Machine-Learning-Meetup/) of Bordeaux. 


## Research Interests

- **Reinforcement Learning:** Open-ended Learning, Automatic Curriculum Learning, Intrinsic Motivation
- **Large Language Models:** Grounding, NLG as decision-making
