For the Global Azure Bootcamp 2017, the anual event organized by Microsoft, the organizers of the event in Bordeaux asked Pierre Leroy and I to do a talk about Machine Learning. As I was using Azure Machine Learning at that time for my work at Weenove, we made a Machine Learning introduction talk and a demo of AzureML.

The audience was mainly constituted of IT professionals.
