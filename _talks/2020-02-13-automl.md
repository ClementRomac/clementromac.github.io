I gave this talk during the annual [Dataquitaine](http://www.dataquitaine.com/conference-ia-ai-datascience-ro-bordeaux-2020) event with one of the co-founders of Weenove. We gave a feedback on the results we obtained using our Automated Machine Learning product on real world cases with our clients.
