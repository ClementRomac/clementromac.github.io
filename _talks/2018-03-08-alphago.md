For the third session of ["Les nuits des réseaux de neurones"](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/Les-nuits-des-reseaux-de-neurones/), Vincent Béraud, Pierre Leroy and I made a talk about [AlphaGo Zero](https://deepmind.com/blog/alphago-zero-learning-scratch/). 

We introduced concepts such as Markov Decision Process, Reinforcement Learning, Q-Learning, Monte Carlo Tree Search or Residual Neural Networks. The goal was to give an intuition to the way AlphaGo Zeron worked.
