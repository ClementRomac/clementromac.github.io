I gave this talk for the ["Bordeaux Machine Learning Meetup"](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/Bordeaux-Machine-Learning-Meetup/), wich was held at [Le Node](https://www.aquinum.fr/le-node/c-est-quoi-le-node.html). Automated Machine Learning has been the subject of my work at Weenove during three years.

I showed an overview of the field of Automated Machine Learning and then explain our work at Weenove and gave feedback from the results we had in applying AutoML on the cases of our clients.
