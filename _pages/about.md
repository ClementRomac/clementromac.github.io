Hi, I’m Clément Romac. After obtaining my High School Diploma with honours, I started studying Computer Science engineering at Ingesup in France. During my second year, I co-created the Artificial Intelligence working group where I discovered fields such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning. I graduated from Ingesup in 2019 with a Data Science specialisation while part time working on Automated Machine Learning in a startup called Weenove. Following this, I obtained a MSc. in theoretical Computer Science at the University of Bordeaux and joined the FLOWERS team at Inria Bordeaux as a Research Engineer.

I am aslo co-animating the monthly [Machine Learning Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/Bordeaux-Machine-Learning-Meetup/) of Bordeaux. 

I love sport (I've been playing football since I am 6 years old) and music (I play bass guitar in a band).
