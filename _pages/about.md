Hi, I’m Clément Romac. After obtaining my High School Diploma with honours, I started studying Computer Science at Ingesup in France. During my second year I co-created a working group with the goal to work on Artificial Intelligence projects. I discovered there fields such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning. I then got a Master’s Degree at Ingesup specialised in Data Science while working in part time on Automated Machine Learning in a startup called Weenove. Following this, I obtained a MSc. in theoretical Computer Science at the University of Bordeaux and joined the FLOWERS team at Inria Bordeaux as a Research Engineer.

I am aslo co-animating a monthly [Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/Bordeaux-Machine-Learning-Meetup/) where we organize talks and workshops on Machine Learning. 

I love sport (I've been playing football since I am 6 years old) and music (I play bass guitar in a band).
