Hi, I’m Clément Romac. After obtaining my High School Degree with honors, I started studying Computer Science at Ingesup in France. During my second year I co-created a working group with the goal to work on Artificial Intelligence projects. I discovered there fields such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning. I then made a Master's Degree at Ingesup specialized in Data Science while working in part time on Automated Machine Learning R&D in a startup called Weenove.

I’ve also co-created and am animating a monthly [Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/Les-nuits-des-reseaux-de-neurones/) where we spend a night discussing and doing projects on Neural Networks with diverse people (students, engineers, Data Scientists...). 

I love sport (I've been playing football since I'm 6 years old) and music (I play bass guitar in a jazz fusion band).
