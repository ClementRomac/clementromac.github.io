Hi, I’m Clément Romac. After obtaining my High School Diploma with honours, I graduated in Computer Science engineering from Ingesup with a Data Science specialisation, while part time working on Automated Machine Learning in a startup called Weenove. 

Following this, I obtained a MSc. in theoretical Computer Science at the University of Bordeaux and joined the FLOWERS team at Inria Bordeaux as a Research Engineer working on [Automatic Curriculum Learning for Deep RL]({{ site.url }}/publication/2021-03-17) and automatic scientific discovery in complex systems (e.g. self-organizing). 

I'm now a first year PhD student jointly supervised by Pierre-Yves Oudyer (FLOWERS, Inria) and Thomas Wolf (Hugging Face) studying how autonomous Deep RL agents can leverage large Language Models.

I am aslo co-animating the monthly [Machine Learning Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/Bordeaux-Machine-Learning-Meetup/) of Bordeaux. 

I love sport (I've been playing football since I am 6 years old) and music (I play bass guitar in a band).
